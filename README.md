# UVDOT UltraVanilla Transit Router

This page was moved from the original UV website due to the amount of upkeep it needs, along with not having to bother the admins to accept a PR every week or so to update the graph.\
It was also partly rewritten to make it slightly easier to maintain, this time around taking full advantage of jQuery and proper nesting/scoping.

## Roadmap

In order of importance:

- [x] Finish the rendering engine
- [ ] Finish the graph, making the router actually useable
- [ ] Finish the Toll Preferences section
- [ ] Port the entire app to use Typescript, and maybe Vue or React
- [ ] Add back the "Scenic" and "Least Transfers" options
